# C++ Concepts and Data Structures Playground

This repository contains a collection of independent C++ projects exploring different programming concepts, data structures, and algorithm implementations. Each folder represents a self-contained experiment or demo, suitable for learning, teaching, or reference.

## 📁 Project Index

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `TestingConcepts_ClassHierarchy` | Demonstrates inheritance, polymorphism, and class relationships. |
| `TestingConcepts_DataStructures_Mixed` | Mix of various custom data structures like lists, stacks, and queues. |
| `TestingConcepts_OutputFormatting` | Experiments with output formatting using `iomanip` and `iostream`. |
| `TestingConcepts_QueueAndStacks` | Implementation and usage of queues and stacks. |
| `TestingConcepts_SortedLinkedList` | Sorted linked list implementation with insert/search/delete logic. |
| `TestingConcepts_SortingSystems` | Sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, etc. |
| `TestingConcepts_Structs` | Usage of C++ `struct` with nested data and operations. |
| `TestingConcepts_TwoDimArrayFunctions` | Matrix and 2D array operations via functions. |

> **Note:** Each project uses its own version of an `ItemType` class, tailored to its logic.

## 🛠️ Build & Run Instructions

### 🔹 Using g++ (Linux/macOS/Git Bash on Windows)

To compile a project:
```bash
cd TestingConcepts_ClassHierarchy
g++ main.cpp -o class_hierarchy
./class_hierarchy
